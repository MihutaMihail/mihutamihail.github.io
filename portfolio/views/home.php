home page <br>

<h4>THEME</h4>
keep the same green theme as the actual CV

<h4>CONTENT</h4>
add a photo of myself (the CV one)
add a link to linkedin and github as well
like in the footer
take the text thing to the right of the picture
in the CV and potentially cut it in two parts

A part that contains a description for myself
and the other part would be the bottom text which
is me saying that I'm looking for a "stage" ...etc
